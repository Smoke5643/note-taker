## Description of project


This application was created to demonstrate how we can leverage the Express module in Node to run a dynamic web application. When the title and body of a note is added, and the save icon is clicked, it will persist in the left hand column. From here, you can click on that saved note at any time to redisplay it. Now we can all keep track of our notes and stay organized!
